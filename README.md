Samrómur aims to collect icelandic voice data which can be used to train voice-recognition software. Data collected via Samrómur is GDPR compliant and will soon be released under a [CC by 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) on Samrómur's website. The dataset consists of multiple wav files containing the voice clips and the corresponding written text files along with demographic data about the speakers.
